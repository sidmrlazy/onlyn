                constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. Through the Rath Yatra, he has extensively traveled throughout the
                state,
                playing a remarkable role in eradicating harmful practices, promoting social rejuvenation, and fostering
                national integration. Additionally, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) conducts regular programs every year to
                raise
                awareness about tree plantation, civic responsibilities, and individual rights.</p>
            <p>Their ideology places utmost importance on Integral Humanism and Cultural Nationalism, and they ardently
                support the 'Param Vaibhavam Netumetasvatram' of the Sangh prayer. Dr. Neeraj Bora, who has been deeply
                involved with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has significantly contributed to the various political
                movements and initiatives led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Continuously and tirelessly, they work
                towards
                advancing the welfare policies of the BJP government and fostering a favorable environment for the
                party.
