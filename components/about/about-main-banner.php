    <h3>How to Engage?</h3>
    <p class="container mb-5">Every project is a unique project and hence – requires very special and dedicated
        treatment.
        Besides the critical
        triangle of cost, time and scope – the working model between the client and the agency also plays a crucial part
        in balancing the former. That’s why we have robust, yet simple models – that are extremely flexible and
        client-centric.</p>
