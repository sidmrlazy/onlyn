                <p class="rectangle-card-details">At Avaneendra Academy, we follow the Montessori method of teaching
                    and
                    have ascertained that it is better from the traditional, verbal, writing assignments-based
                    methods
                    of teaching, this enables us to reach out to our students- more efficiently. We try to inculcate
                    various dimensions of intelligence while designing our curriculum.</p>

                    in
                    simple words can be said to be the study on how best to teach. Our pedagogy is a fine blend of
                    time-proven educational philosophies. We use a fine mix of these pedagogies to bring out the
                    best in
                    every child. The pedagogies and educational philosophies mean nothing if they are not connected

                    certain learning outcomes.</p>

                    that the best
                    way of teaching a child is through taking up activities. We have incorporated activities such as
                    role plays, virtual games, singing, free play and a lot more, to teach children. We believe that
                    such a method of learning brings exposure to the child in a friendly environment with no
                    pressure at
                    all. The focus is entirely on the needs of the child and the activities revolve around
                    fulfilling
                    such needs. </p>

                    tender
                    care of a mother-teacher till Grade II. This concept helps in understanding the child and
                    developing
                    an emotional bond between the learner and teacher. Helps in better insight to various
                    developmental
                    stages of the child, especially cognitive and emotional. Both the learner and teacher spend more
                    time with each other and the teacher personally knows the areas of concern. Academically it
                    gives
                    time for the child to remain abreast with his peers. </p>
