        <p>A MESSAGE FROM</p>
        <h3>Our Founder</h3>
        <h5><strong>Mr. R.P. Singh</strong></h5>
        <p>It gives me an immense sense of happiness and honor to announce that AVANEENDRA ACADEMY is all set to
            commence its new session with renewed enthusiasm and commitment to impart quality 360 degree education to
            its extra inquisitive learners. I look forward to incorporating meaningful and modern pedagogic insights
            rendered by our extremely competent faculty. I would request all parents to gift their children their
            “time”- that by far remains the best present. I also wish to sensitize the parents to not burden the
            children with their own patronizing ambitions and longings. Children in all honesty want supportive hands
            that can assist them to identify their own latent talent and groom them to be what they wish to be. For this
            purpose we request you to partner with us and join hands to provide our children with effective tools of
            learning that help them to make their own identity rather than be predecessors of genius.</p>

        <p>I would like to extend my heartiest felicitations and gratitude to all the parents for having faith in our
            institution. I would like to invite all those parents who are yet to join our dream. We need your
            participation and involvements in helping our children to shape their efforts on their way to destiny.We
            seek your participation, guidance and blessings.</p>

        <p>A MESSAGE FROM</p>
        <h3>Our Director</h3>
        <h5><strong>Mrs. Sushma Singh</strong></h5>
        <p>The purpose of education is not just to produce academicians- but also to develop humane and sensitive
            citizens. At AVANEENDRA ACADEMY, we ensure that a congenial environment for learning is maintained while
            making sure that children have enough opportunities to develop their personal and interpersonal skills. Our
            teachers are well qualified and share a passion for teaching, thereby bringing out the best in both
            themselves and their students.
            We firmly believe that parents' role in the Child’s educational development is crucial. It is the parents
            who are the first GURU of the child. So we create mutual respect and strive to establish continuous
            communication between parents, teachers and administration. We pride ourselves on creating a culture of
            learning where students are free to express or share their interest in a variety of fields while developing
            their character as well.
        </p>
        <p>Avaneendra Academy is more than an ordinary school. We encourage students to embark on difficult, challenging
            journeys that stretch their potential. But we do so with an unyielding faith in the capacities of our
            teachers and students. The management and staff of Avaneendra Academy is deeply committed to work tirelessly
            in order to make our students’ learning experience an exciting and elucidating one.</p>

        <p>A MESSAGE FROM</p>
        <h3>Our Principal</h3>
        <h5><strong>Mrs. Akanksha Singh</strong></h5>
        <p>Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job but a lifelong process which creates an
            understanding of moral and ethical values to guide one’s life in a right path. As a parent, you want the
            best for your child and we are proud to be working with you to ensure that they are given the right
            knowledge to face the future challenges. Parents, students and the school authorities are a team and we have
            to complement each other’s efforts.
            At AVANEENDRA ACADEMY , we focus on complete development of our students by involving them in both
            scholastic & co-scholastic activities as suggested by CBSE.

            <strong>“If a plant is carefully nurtured by a gardener, it will become good, and produce better
                fruits.”</strong> Therefore,
            children must be given good training from their earliest childhood. We are here for the same. I am sure that
            our students of today, tomorrow will carry forward the Motto of love and unity entrusted in their hands at
            AVANEENDRA ACADEMY
