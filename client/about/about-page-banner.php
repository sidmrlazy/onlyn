        <h1>What we stand for </h1>
        <p>Our foundation stone was laid on 21st April, 2015 by the people of Vigyan Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. We
            strive for excellence not only in the field of education but also in discipline. </p>

        <p>Avaneendra Academy is the best school in Lucknow. We are unique because we are sincerely focused on
            developing our students so that when they leave us they are ready for the world and are able to create
            happy, successful and productive lives for themselves. For this the students need three things from their
            schooling- Knowledge, Discipline and becoming confident individuals. At Avaneendra Academy we focus on
            holistic learning and developing experiences along with helping our students work on their personalities,
            co-curriculum skills, and sports.</p>
