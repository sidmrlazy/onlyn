        <p>Each child is unique. When we designed our curriculum, we wanted it curated in a way for it to adapt itself
            specifically to needs of each child. With the learner at the center of the teaching- learning process, we
            focus on learning through activities and projects, inquiry-based learning, and also through innovative
            pedagogy, benchmarking the best practices from across the world. The curriculum is designed to enable

        <p class="mb-5">With a constructivist approach to curriculum, we believe asking questions, learning by doing,
            and projects
            will provide experiential learning for life. Workshops, seminars, games, activities, reading, collaborative
            projects, films, seminars, and expeditions are regularly conducted to ensure that learning is not restricted
            to the physical classroom itself. Our curriculum stands on a broad base of understanding a childâ€™s
            psychological, emotional, intellectual and social needs.</p>
