    <h2><span>INNOVATIVE</span> CURRICULUM</h2>
    <p>At Jaipuria, we always have the child at the center of all our processes. We also believe in the power of
        self:
        Self-knowledge, Self-control, Self-assessment and Self-learning. These are the mainstays of the
        Curriculum @
        Jaipuria.</p>

    <p>We have also developed a unique pedagogy which encourages learning more than mere completion of tasks,
        innovatively named ‘NO SCHOOL’. The idea is that our students should look at teaching-learning as a way
        of
        life,
        not as a compulsion. NO SCHOOL infuses the spirit of experiential learning by fun, thereby creating
        lifelong
        learners. We have aimed to nurture the upcoming generation with all-round development of mind, body and
        soul.
        The curriculum aspires to create self-thinking, reflective individuals who have the courage to stop,
        think
        and
        reflect at every step of their educational journey.</p>

    <p>The NO SCHOOL pedagogy has been intentionally divided into four phases:</p>

        <p>The benchmark for the curriculum development process was National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005), which has
            a detailed structured approach for each subject. To enhance the content and make it more holistic, we also
            took important lessons from international curricular standards (mainly the Common Core standards from USA,
            the National Curriculum from UK, Finland and Sweden etc.).</p>

        <p>In today’s context wherein the world is getting increasingly competitive and demands innovation from every
            student, the curriculum entails the learning level for each student. It defines the cognitive level at which
            students will be able to operate with the content. It is influenced by many leading taxonomies, including
            educational philosophers such as Bloom, Anderson, Robert Marzano and John Kendall. We are living in an era
            where we are preparing students for a society that we have not yet seen, and can only imagine.</p>

        <p><strong>Therefore, 21st Century Skills become important.</strong></p>

        <p>Today, we need a curriculum, which should not only be student-centric, however, unprecedented amongst the
            existing ones. The teacher is required to achieve the aims of education. For that purpose, we must enable
            them to employ suitable instructional methods and procedures, and that is the purpose of the Jaipuria
            curriculum!</p>
