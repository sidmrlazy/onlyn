            <h2>INNOVATIVE CURRICULUM</h2>
            <p>At Jaipuria, we always have the child at the center of all our processes. We also believe in the power of
                self:
                Self-knowledge, Self-control, Self-assessment and Self-learning. These are the mainstays of the
                Curriculum @
                Jaipuria.</p>

            <p>We have also developed a unique pedagogy which encourages learning more than mere completion of tasks,
                innovatively named ‘NO SCHOOL’. The idea is that our students should look at teaching-learning as a way
                of
                life,
                not as a compulsion. NO SCHOOL infuses the spirit of experiential learning by fun, thereby creating
                lifelong
                learners. We have aimed to nurture the upcoming generation with all-round development of mind, body and
                soul.
                The curriculum aspires to create self-thinking, reflective individuals who have the courage to stop,
                think
                and
                reflect at every step of their educational journey.</p>

            <p>The NO SCHOOL pedagogy has been intentionally divided into four phases:</p>
