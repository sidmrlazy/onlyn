            <p>Crescendo is a stage where little Jaipurians give wings to their budding talents and take it higher.
                Crescendo provides a platform for all those who want to showcase their extra ordinary talent. Crescendo
                highlights the development of an individual through various competitions, so that they become more
                confident and ensures a bright future for our country.
            </p>

            <p>The idea is to provide a learning opportunity to students alongside a platform to showcase their talents.
                Crescendo defines the zeal for excellence and is focused on the holistic development of children.
                Crescendo is a great platform where students are learned to overcome the challenges of the future. It
                provides an opportunity for students to bond with each other, learn about cities and explore different
                cultures.

            <p>The world has changed, and the pandemic has accentuated the need for life skills more than every before.
                At Jaipuria, flipped learning, student-led classrooms, collaborative learning through team projects,
                case studies and inter-disciplinary projects has always been the cornerstone of educational focus. We
                offer innovative and integrated approach to learning. For instance, we offer learning through
                Interdisciplinary Projects, (IDP), integrating ideas, perspectives, hypothesis, opinions and guiding
                principles from multiple disciplines to systematically form a more complete framework of assay offering
                a higher learning and understanding of the given topic. Imagine, an opportunity for a student to embark
                on learning mathematics and chemistry through the exciting texts of Harry Potter whilst collaborating
                with their peers! Jaipuria Schools will in the futurecollaborate with schools globally to enrich these
                projects further.</p>

            <p>This unique method synthesises learning from different disciplines to take children deeper into one
                chosen theme or concept. It allows for children to learn a more inclusive perspective at their own pace.
            </p>

            <p>Whilst this is in line with the focus of the curriculum framework and the recent NEP 2020, all
                assessments are done for 21st century skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, collaboration,
                communication , information literacy, technology literacy and others.</p>

            <p>This also brings in learning beyond content, including FLEXIBILITY, MEDIA LITERACY, LEADERSHIP,
                INITIATIVE, PRODUCTIVITY, SOCIAL SKILLS. There is attempt to get going on bagless-days and structured
                mentorship at schools.</p>

            <p>*Jaipuria designs the learning experience keeping my needs in mind. That is why learning and growing is
                so much fun here!*</p>

            <p>Quality education is a dire need of the hour. Education that matters; the one that brings a positive
                change in society and the world at large. To meet this noble objective, we need teachers of high caliber
                and outlook. The belief that a teacher is the backbone of a society is still practical and relevant.</p>

            <p>Seth M. R. Jaipuria Schools, since its conception, has been of the same belief that developing a
                progressive teacher is developing a reformist set of children, which will further add to the cause and a
                better society will emerge from around us.</p>

            <p>In this quest, the Corporate Office of Seth M. R. Jaipuria Schools has been working determinedly on
                grooming the Jaipurian teachers through constant teacher-development programs, workshops and rigorous
                training.</p>

            <p>Upskill - Scale up your skills, The Refresher Teachersâ€™ Training in the same direction is a yearly
                episode that ensures 100 percent inclusion of all Jaipurian teachers across all Seth M. R. Jaipuria
                Schools. Teachers of all the subjects attend specific training sessions from the finest trainers from
                across the country.</p>
