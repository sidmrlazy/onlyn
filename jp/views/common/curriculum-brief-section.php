                <p>Designed and executed with the utmost care and attention, the curriculum helps these young minds
                    deepen their understanding of the world around them, broaden their curiosity and unleash their
                    imagination. Care is taken to introduce the little ones to the real world without uprooting their
                    innocence and natural creative instincts. Thus, each lesson plan is curated with a focus on four
                    major areas i.e. socio-emotional development, cognitive development, physical development and
                    creative development.</p>

                <h4>CLASS 1 - CLASS 4</h4>
                <p>As the young minds start developing ideas of their own, our curriculum aids them by encouraging
                    inquiry and exploration. From enquiry-based learning focus shifts on integration of knowledge,
                    development of critical thinking, problem solving and value based education.</p>

                <p>At the Junior School level, the teaching pedagogy shifts to an ‘in transition’ stage. Learning moves
                    beyond the traditional ‘board and text’ mediums to give way to classroom discussions, field visits
                    and experiential learning processes.</p>

                <p>Learning isn’t restricted to academics alone; students are encouraged to introspect and give voice to
                    their opinions and ideas. The emotional quotient of each and every child is strengthened as much as
                    his or her intelligent quotient is; freedom of expression is encouraged and inner happiness is given
                    prominence.</p>

                <p>As the students come into their own being and become more set and sure of their ways, the curriculum
                    too shifts on ‘enhancing personas’ rather than shaping them. Teachings of the great Sri Aurobindo
                    are extensively taught at this stage; ideas of self – worth and one’s duties towards others and the
                    Nation are brought to light. Students are offered a richening educational experience through
                    facilities like the MindSpark Labs, NimbleQ and fully equipped Science Labs. Non – scholastic
                    activities gain importance, talent is showcased and children work in collaboration with the
                    teachers.</p>

                <p>Seeds sowed years ago finally start bearing fruit. The student-teacher relationship changes and the
                    bond forged at this point goes beyond academics. Teachers become friends and the class becomes one
                    being. Learning too moves into another dimension. As students are prepared to step out in the real
                    world, the focus shifts on hands-on knowledge, practical application and experiential learning.
                    Field visits are organized, case studies are discussed and leadership is nurtured. Each and every
                    student is encouraged to set his or her goal and complete guidance is given to achieve the set goal.
                    Remedial and Enrichment classes are conducted, ensuring that no student lags in their academics. The
                    students are also encouraged to undertake a variety of personal projects to consciously transform
                    themselves, the society and the Nation at large.</p>
