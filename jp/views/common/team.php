    <h3>Mr. Ved Prakash Gupta</h3>
    <h4>President - Seth M. R. Jaipuria School, Faizabad</h4>
    <p>Welcome to Seth M. R. Jaipuria School, Faizabad!</p>
    <p>Jaipuria is led by doyens of exceptional vision who have always remained concerned about developing next
        generation thought leaders. The commitment of the House of Jaipuria to providing superior quality
        education has only deepened and grown over the last seven decades, developing leaders who have proved
        their mettle in all walks of life.</p>

    <p>A true leader is a liberated thinker. The process of liberation begins when you start to think for
        yourself. When you think you learn and you imbibe new thoughts and perspectives. This in turn helps you
        innovate and think out of the box. When you can think differently, you can make choices and decisions
        that are unconventional. These unconventional choices and decisions are what will set you apart from the
        crowd and establish you as a leader rather than the led.</p>

    <p>Education is not merely the acquiring of a degree; it is an enduring process that should have an effect
        on your thoughts and actions, even after you graduate. Your education can become a leadership training
        exercise only when you are an active participant in the process of opening your mind to knowledge,
        experiences and ideas.</p>

    <p>We are very glad to bring to Faizabad a champion of educational excellence. We present to you Seth M. R.
        Jaipuria School, Faizabad, where, we put the student at the heart of the educational process. A
        student’s tenure at Jaipuria will be marked by a number of academic and non academic opportunities, each
        of which will help the student develop into a successful individuals, true leaders and above all good
        human beings. From inclass sessions to field trips to experiential learning to festivals and events,
        every day at Jaipuria is a day our students learn and develop.</p>

    <p>A world of learning and a plethora of experiences await you within our school. Welcome to Seth M. R.
        Jaipuria School, Faizabad! Welcome to your future.</p>
